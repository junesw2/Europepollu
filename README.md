# Population exposure to multiple air pollutants and its compound episodes in Europe


This study estimated daily ambient PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 concentrations at a 0.1-degree resolution across Europe during 2003-2019, to assess the occurrence of days exceeding WHOâ€™s 2021 guidelines (unclean air days) for one or multiple pollutants (compound days) in 1426 regions across 35 European countries, representing 543 million people.

We derived the estimations from diverse sources like ground-based measurements, satellite observations, modelled aerosol data, atmospheric reanalysis and quantile machine learning to capture the nuanced spatiotemporal variations in air pollution.

These estimations were used to estimate the spatial heterogeneity and temporal evolution of (i) air pollution concentrations and the (ii) population count and (iii) cumulative time of exposure to concentrations exceeding the 2021 short-term and long-term WHO guidelines. Moreover, we analyzed for the first time the joint exceedance of WHO limits simultaneously for two or more air pollutants, providing a comprehensive assessment of compound days.
